                Hi, I'm Seth Lewis(otherwise known as Motif.) I like
                to take up a lot of creative projects in various fields,
                mostly computer and machine related. My main
                motivations for my tech projects are usually
                <br>
                <br>
                A. because I have a cool idea
                <br>
                B. because I want something custom-made
                <br>
                or C. because the actual thing is too expensive
                <br>
                <br>
                In particular, my favorite projects are always when I'm making games. Talking about game design and
                3d graphics/physics is one of my favorite ways to annoy my friends, if they make the unfortunate decision
                to tell me about a game they're playing. I stand by the idea that hypercasuals are hardly games as much as they are drugs,
                that a good game developer interacts with their community, and that
                video games can absolutely be art in much of the same way as a movie or book.
                <br>
                <br>
                Other small facts: I love music and art styles from the '80s, capybaras are my spirit animal, and i'm the proud owner of a 
                <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0rkglfmFP5AAP0p0XbJLJD?si=ae9a603df3b64a82" target=”_blank” rel="noopener noreferrer">spotify playlist</a>
                consisting of the Family Guy intro repeated 9,999 times.
                <br>
                I was also a lifeguard at one point, paradoxically.
