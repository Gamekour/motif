                Hi, I'm Seth Lewis(otherwise known as Motif.) I like
                to take up a lot of creative projects in various fields,
                mostly computer and machine related. My main
                motivations for my tech projects are usually
                <br>
                <br>
                A. because I have a cool idea
                <br>
                B. because I want something custom-made
                <br>
                or C. because the actual thing is too expensive.
                <br>
                <br>
                Other small things about me include my love for 80s and 90s
                related styles/music, my upmost appreciation of capybaras, and
                my 300 song playlist of nothing but the Family Guy intro on repeat.
                <br>
                I was also a lifeguard once. For some reason.
                <br>
                <br>
                And yes, I make games. Talking about game design and specific elements
                of 3d graphics/physics is one of my favorite ways to annoy my friends.
                I stand by the fact that hypercasuals are hardly games as much as they are drugs,
                that a good game developer interacts with their community, and that
                The Stanley Parable is probably the best thing to have ever graced the Steam marketplace.
