            <p>
                Uses a Raspberry Pi 3 to run an AM synth and control
                it with MIDI input

                <h4>starting out</h4>
                I first got the idea to do this with an arduino. My goal was simple,
                that I wanted to be able to take my Akai MPK mini and just play it
                wherever without needing a PC and music software, just a charged
                speaker and a keyboard. I was also planning to experiment with
                reading output from a PS2 game glove to control the app, but
                I could never get it to actually read anything even after
                quadruple checking the pinouts and using about 20 different libraries.
                Oh well, keyboards are still cool.
                <h4>pi stuff</h4>
                It proved
                very quickly to be impossible after learning how USB worked and that
                you can't just plug devices into eachother. So, new plan, I took out
                a Raspberry Pi (which was very graciously donated by a friend of mine)
                and installed a basic app I found labeled "amsynth". After a quick
                search of how to connect a USB driver and actually use it with the app,
                I finally got it to play sounds! I could hit a key, and something would
                come out. In terms of the speaker, I just plugged in a small bluetooth
                speaker that had an aux port and set it as the pi's main output.
                After that, I had a bit of fun trying to find out how to autorun an app
                on linux, which took about an hour for some reason since two of the autorun
                methods didn't work at all, but after that I got it to just run a python
                script which in turn started up the whole system and connected the keyboard.
                <h4>zynthian</h4>
                The approach of using an entire desktop to run one app felt kind of
                off, so I went ahead and looked around for better solutions. It turned
                out that there was an entire operating system, named Zynthian, which
                was engineered for the exact purpose I was looking for - but it was
                intended to be used with the rest of its kit, which included a couple knobs.
                I installed it anyways, and after a couple boot loops it got itself working
                (don't ask me how) and I spent about 2 hours trying to understand the
                interface. Unlike amsynth, which allowed me to just right click and set a
                knob to change a parameter, Zynthian had a huge complicated system of
                using hotkeys and manually assigning midi channels. This wasn't the only
                complicated part; I couldn't even figure out how to get presets working
                (which I had no issue with on amsynth.) My bank switches didn't work(which
                is what I had used before to quickly select presets) and a lot of
                random buttons affected things they weren't supposed to, so in the end
                I just reverted back to running piOS with amsynth.
                <h4>conclusion</h4>
                At the time of writing this, it still works, however I've realized that
                a laptop really isn't that big of a hassle to bring around and thus
                haven't used the pi system much lately. It's still fun to go back and pull it out
                whenever I have friends by but for the most part this whole endeavor has
                been a lesson that possibly one of the best things you can do in improvising
                is to consider what is and isn't worth your time.
