            <h3>summary</h3>
            <p>
                Memory's Abyss is a creative writing project and game series 
                following the story of a lost child in a computerized dream simulation.
                <br>
                <br>
                The project has been the source of numerous games, artworks, creative
                writing pieces, and concept journals since its beginnings in 2018.

                    Bladesync, a simple multiplayer shooter for VR is
                    developed in concept. It features two distinct red
                    and blue cube-shaped blasters which, in combination
                    with red and blue environmental pieces, add a
                    portal-like puzzle element to a competitive genere

                    While developing the plans for this game in a tiny pocket notebook,
                    I have a dream one night about an underground facility.
                    This dream, labeled sector C, inspires the entirety of journal 1
                    of Memory's Abyss. Using the blaster concept previously mentioned,
                    the game is reimagined as a singleplayer campaign set in a dream world.

                    Months after the first journal, a game demo is released
                    to youtube featuring two pogo sticks being used to jump around in VR.
                    The point of this was to demonstrate a physics system where you could push
                    against a surface and have an equal force applied backwards, something
                    that was intended to be used with the blasters.
                    <br>
                    As is quite obvious from the video, I was not as strong a developer
                    then to any extent. The whole thing was full of bugs. But
                    hey, at least I had something to show the world.

                    This code, over a month later, would be used to make a simple climbing
                    demo using the same system, just slightly more refined.

                    <br>
                    This project was scrapped, and a new demo wouldn't come out for a long time.

                    Meanwhile, it was nearing the end of the school year, and at this point
                    I had nearly finished my second journal containing much of the modern
                    storyline and game structure of Memory's abyss, some of which still stands at
                    the time of writing this. There were(and still are) notes taken on
                    my phone as well, mostly containing story elements and dream descriptions.

                    It's important to note that at this point the technical side of the project
                    goes silent for almost an entire year at this point. Throughout 8th grade,
                    I did a whole lot of learning. That's to say, I had a couple friends, 
                    and I was doing well in my classes.

                    After months of doing absolutely nothing, I finally decide to go back
                    seeing as I had completely run out of things to do. With the help of
                    my friend nyanomalous, the first Unity project(which is now the project of
                    Memory's Abyss Chapter Zero) is created under the organization name
                    "catboy devs". This organization would later be known as nostalgia garden.

                    It took a lot of work but once I released it, I knew not a second had
                    been wasted. Memory's abyss demo 1, aka Memory's Abyss: Limestone
                    was released to itch.io(it is still available for download on the
                    <a href="https://motif-nostalgia.itch.io/chapter-zero">Chapter Zero page</a>.) I'll admit, it was kind of janky, it had a weird
                    rotation system and a weird music cutoff. You couldn't even reach the secret
                    ending that was intended to be there. But it served well as a demonstration
                    that I wasn't joking around about this game, that it would not die
                    with the rest of my ideas.

                    Half a year in development, the first version of Chapter Zero is released
                    (this version is also available on the <a href="https://motif-nostalgia.itch.io/chapter-zero">itch.io page</a>.) It contains
                    levels, movement types, and music that all tie together to tell
                    the story I had been trying to plan for nearly a year.
                    <br> Nobody played it, and I was fine with that.
                    <br> What I was not fine with, however, was the burning feeling that
                    the game was incomplete. So, over the course of a summer, I worked to update
                    the project to with a new rendering system, new set of music, and a
                    couple secret levels to really make it feel like a full game.

                    I did it.
                    <br>
                    In celebration, I did what no depressed indie dev could ever dream of:
                    I hosted my game at a convention. It was weird, my ragged old setup with a
                    CRT monitor and a laptop running a game made by some 16 year old
                    in a onesie. Most people couldn't even make it past the first level, to which
                    I responded by <i>updating the game</i> in the middle of the convention.
                    <br>
                    But people were interested. I got over 12 people to sign up for a 
                    mailing list to the game, and to me that was amazing. 12 people thinking
                    about my game?? That's a whole lot better than 1.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Additionally, I released my game to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2137790/Memorys_Abyss_Chapter_Zero/">steam</a>(completely for free.)
