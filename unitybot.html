            <h3>summary</h3>
            <p>
                Never gave this project a name, but it was essentially an experiment
                in making a game that could be run from discord that eventually evolved
                into a debugging console for unity.

            <h3>how it worked</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> a discord bot running on my pc (which was nicknamed heisenburg) would
                    scan a specific discord channel for a message starting with its name and "invoke"
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> if heisenburg found such a message, it would then follow certain criteria to
                    read parameters from the message (and send back errors if the format was invalid)
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> the resulting text would be forwarded via a unity-pyhon interface in which the unity application
                    also running on my pc would listen for text on a specific port that heisenburg could send to
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> unity would read that text and try to match it to an object, component, and function based on the
                    parameters it read from heisenburg(and report any errors in the process)
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> if all went according to plan(which it did eventually) the target function would run
                    and a webhook from unity would send back a message like "success" or "did [thing]".
                </li>
                <br>
            </ol>
